      Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by inflammation and swelling in the wrist
      area that places pressure on the median nerve. You might be at risk for
      carpal tunnel syndrome if you have diabetes, arthritis, or high blood
      pressure, among other conditions, or if carpal tunnel syndrome runs in
      your family. Indications of nerve compression include aches or pains in
      your fingers, hand or arm, numbness or tingling, a weak thumb or
      difficulty gripping. As the compression of the nerve worsens, you may
      likely be forced out of work until you achieve relief.

      In Open carpal tunnel surgery, which is the most common technique, the
      surgeon makes a large incision in the center of the palm and cuts through
      layers of skin and tissue to release the median nerve in the carpal
      tunnel. Recovery takes longer because there is a wound on the palm itself
      which is a high-pressure area on the hand.


      In the endoscopic carpal tunnel release, the surgeon makes a small
      incision in the folds of the wrist and guides a thin tube containing a
      telescope attached to a camera directly to the surgical site, where he
      cuts the ligament forming the roof the carpal tunnel and releases pressure
      on the median nerve. No splinting is required, just a bulky bandage.

      The single-port endoscopic carpal tunnel release is the most advanced and
      effective treatment for the pain, numbness and tingling caused by carpal
      tunnel syndrome. No cutting through skin and tissue. No large stitches. No
      long weeks of recovery. Instead, the surgeon makes a tiny incision in the
      folds of the wrist and guides a thin tube containing a camera directly to
      the surgical site, where he cuts the ligament surrounding the carpal
      tunnel and releases pressure from the median nerve. The surgery takes
      about 15 minutes. National Carpal Tunnel Center patients are often back at
      work in as little as 48 hours, with only a tiny scar in the fold of the
      wrist.
