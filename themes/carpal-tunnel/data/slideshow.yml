      This is a minimal invasive procedure. In the endoscopic carpal tunnel
      release, the surgeon makes a small incision in the folds of the wrist and
      guides a thin tube containing a telescope attached to a camera directly to
      the surgical site, where he cuts the ligament forming the roof the carpal
      tunnel and releases pressure on the median nerve. No splinting is
      required, just a bulky bandage.
