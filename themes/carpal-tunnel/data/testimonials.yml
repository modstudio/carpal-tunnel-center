      Dr. Green is a very meticulous doctor and you can tell he honestly cares
      about his patients' outcomes. He did an excellent job on my carpal tunnel
      surgery and even talked me out of a different additional expensive
      cosmetic procedure I wanted because he thought I would not be a good
      candidate. Good results and good doctor.

      Amazing doctor and wonderful human being. If only there were more people
      like him - trustworthy, honest, sympathetic, empathetic... I can't say
      enough! He literally changed my life. Helped me in so many ways, thank
      you!
