      This is a minimal invasive procedure. 


      In Open carpal tunnel surgery, which is the most common technique, the
      surgeon makes a large incision in the center of the palm and cuts through
      layers of skin and tissue to release the median nerve in the carpal
      tunnel. Recovery takes longer because there is a wound on the palm itself
      which is a high-pressure area on the hand.


      In the endoscopic carpal tunnel release, the surgeon makes a small
      incision in the folds of the wrist and guides a thin tube containing a
      telescope attached to a camera directly to the surgical site, where he
      cuts the ligament forming the roof the carpal tunnel and releases pressure
      on the median nerve. No splinting is required, just a bulky bandage.
