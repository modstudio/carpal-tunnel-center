      I am extremely meticulous and it is rare for me to be satisfied with
      service or results. Dr. Green is a very meticulous doctor and you can tell
      he honestly cares about his patients' outcomes. He did an excellent job on
      my carpal tunnel surgery and even talked me out of a different additional
      expensive cosmetic procedure I wanted because he thought I would not be a
      good candidate. Good results and good doctor.
